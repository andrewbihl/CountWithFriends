# CountWithFriend

This is the repository for the iOS App "Count Off – Multiplayer Puzzle Game". The app can be found on the [app store](bit.ly/countoffapp).

The game is a turn based multiplayer game in which each player receives a set of 6 numbers and a target number. Using the four basic operations, the player must create an equation that uses all 6 numbers with a result as close to the target number as possible. Scoring is based on which player gets closer to the result. 

The app uses Apple's GameCenter framework to handle the player matching and other multiplayer functions.

A single player mode still needs to be added. Other changes to be made are improvements to the scoring system, the ability to quit and existing game, the ability to invite/play friends, and a global leaderboard.

Feel free to email countoffapp@gmail.com with any questions, comments, etc.
